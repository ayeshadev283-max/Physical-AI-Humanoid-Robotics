# Appendix A: Prerequisites

This textbook assumes graduate-level proficiency in the following areas.

## Programming

### Python 3.x (Required)
- Object-oriented programming
- NumPy/SciPy for numerical computing
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Virtual environments (venv, conda)

**Recommended Resources**:
- Python Official Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
- NumPy Documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/

### C++ (Recommended)
- Basic syntax and compilation
- Pointers and memory management
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- CMake build system

**Use Cases**: ROS 2 performance-critical nodes, custom Gazebo plugins

## Mathematics

### Linear Algebra
- Vector and matrix operations
- Transformations (rotation, translation)
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Matrix decompositions (SVD, QR)

### Calculus
- Derivatives and gradients
- Partial derivatives
- Chain rule (for backpropagation)
- Numerical integration

### Probability and Statistics
- Probability distributions (Gaussian, uniform)
- Bayes' theorem
- Expected value and variance
- Covariance matrices

**Recommended Resources**:
- Linear Algebra review: Khan Academy
- Probabilistic Robotics (Thrun et al., 2005) - Appendix B

## AI/ML Background (Helpful but Optional)

### Machine Learning Basics
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Training, validation, test splits
- Overfitting and regularization
- Loss functions and optimization

### Neural Networks
- Feedforward networks
- Backpropagation
- Activation functions
- Gradient descent variants (SGD, Adam)

### Reinforcement Learning (Optional)
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Q-learning concepts
- Policy gradient methods

**Recommended Resources**:
- Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course (Coursera)
- Deep Learning Book (Goodfellow et al., 2016)

## Development Tools

### Version Control
- Git basics (clone, commit, push, pull)
- GitHub/GitLab workflows
- Branching and merging

### Command Line
- Linux terminal navigation
- Package managers (apt, pip, npm)
- SSH and remote access
- Text editors (vim, nano, or VSCode)

### Containerization (Optional)
- Docker basics
- docker-compose for multi-container setups

## Hardware Understanding

### Basic Robotics Concepts
- Sensors vs actuators
- Feedback control loops
- Kinematics vs dynamics
- Coordinate frames and transformations

**Note**: No prior ROS or robotics experience required - we cover these from first principles.

## Time Commitment

- **Reading**: ~3-5 hours per module
- **Exercises**: ~2-4 hours per module
- **Code examples**: ~2-6 hours per module (Docker setup + execution)
- **Total**: 40-60 hours for complete textbook

## Self-Assessment Quiz

Before starting, ensure you can answer:

1. What is the difference between a list and a NumPy array in Python?
2. How do you multiply two matrices?
3. What is Bayes' theorem and when is it useful?
4. What is the difference between supervised and reinforcement learning?
5. How do you create a Git branch and merge it?

If you struggle with these, review the recommended resources above.
